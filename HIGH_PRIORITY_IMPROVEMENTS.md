- ✅ **Development workflow restored** - All npm scripts now work on Windows

### **📊 Test Results After Fix**
```bash
Test Suites: 6 passed, 6 total ✅
Tests:       112 passed, 112 total ✅
Coverage:    32.58% (baseline established)
Time:        3.3 seconds
```

### **✨ Impact Achieved**

- ✅ Categorized logging: security, performance, system, redis events
- ✅ JSON structured output for production log aggregation
- ✅ Daily rotating files with automatic log archival
- ✅ Request correlation IDs and structured context
- ✅ **All 16 console statements** migrated to structured logging across middleware

✅ **Complete Middleware Logging Conversion**

- ✅ `sensitiveEndpointLimiter.ts`: Security violations and access logging
- ✅ `validation.ts`: Request/response validation errors
- ✅ `logger.ts`: Rate limit decisions and performance warnings
- ✅ `index.ts`: General middleware errors and system events
- ✅ `jwtAuth.ts`: JWT authentication success/failure events

✅ **Production Metrics & Monitoring**
- ✅ **Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint** with comprehensive metrics:
  - Request/response metrics with quantiles (p50, p95, p99)
  - Rate limiting statistics and blocked request counts
  - Memory usage (heap, external, RSS) and performance metrics
  - Error rates, requests per second, system uptime
  - Redis connectivity status for infrastructure monitoring

✅ **Log Category Implementation**
```typescript
// Security events with structured context
log.security('JWT authentication failed', {
  eventType: 'auth_failure',
  severity: 'medium',
  error: error.message,
  endpoint: req.path,
  method: req.method
});

// Performance monitoring with metrics
log.performance('Request rate limited', {
  method: req.method,
  endpoint: req.path,
  responseTime: 250,
  remaining: 0,
  metadata: { rule: 'sensitive_endpoint' }
});

// System events with operational context
log.system('Rate limiter middleware error - failing open', {
  error: error.message,
  algorithm: 'token-bucket',
  severity: 'medium'
});
