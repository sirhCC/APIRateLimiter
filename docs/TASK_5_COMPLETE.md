- Container security scanning

### ðŸ“Š Package Configuration

#### âœ… Updated Scripts
```json
{
  "test:enhanced": "jest --testPathPatterns=enhanced-coverage",
  "test:chaos": "jest --testPathPatterns=chaos-engineering", 
  "test:simple": "jest --testPathPatterns=simple-middleware",
  "test:load": "k6 run tests/load-test.js",
  "test:all-coverage": "npm run test:simple && npm run test:enhanced && npm run test:chaos"
}
```

#### âœ… Development Dependencies
- Enhanced Jest configuration
